## 5/25 Strategy : Choose and Focus

This app is inspired by the Warren Buffett's anecdote.

Buffett advised his pilot, Mike Plint, on the way of achieving career goals.

Buffett's advice is like :

First, Write 25 wishes you want to accomplish in your lifetime.
Second, Choose the Top 5 goals which are the most important.
Finally, Discard the others so that you focus on your 5 goals.

Based on the buffet's advice, this app has just 3 steps like below :

STEP 1. Add 25 wishes.
STEP 2. Swipe right 20 Wishes to give up.
STEP 3. Swipe left 5 Wishes to set your goals.

Following these steps, you can choose the most important thing in your life and focus on.

Just ADD and SWIPE!
