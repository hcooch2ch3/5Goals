5/25 Strategy : Choose and Focus

This app is inspired by the Warren Buffett's story.

Buffett advised his pilot, Mike Plint, about the way of achieving career goals.

Buffett's said like this :


    First, Write the 25 wishes you want to realize in your life time. Second, Choose the Top 5 goals which are the most important. Finally, Discard the others so that focus on your 5 goals.

    STEP 1. Add 25 wishes. 
    STEP 2. Swipe right 20 Wishes to give-up.
    STEP 3. Swipe left 5 Wishes to set goals.
